# Botany Laboratory

Python implementations of the algorithms found in the book "The Algorithmic Beauty of Plants" by Przemyslaw Prusinkiewicz and Aristid Lindenmayer published in 1990.

The goal of this project is to deepen my understanding of patterns found in nature to provide me design inspiration.

This is an ongoing project that I append to as I read the book.
